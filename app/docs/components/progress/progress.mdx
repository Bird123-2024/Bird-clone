Rounded Style: When rounded prop is set to true, the progress bar will have rounded edges, giving it a smooth and visually pleasing look.

Bordered Style: By using the bordered prop with a value of true, a border will be added around the progress bar. This enhances its visibility and creates a clear visual contrast with the surrounding content.
