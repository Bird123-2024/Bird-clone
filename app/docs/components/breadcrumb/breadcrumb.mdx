## Table of Contents

The Breadcrumbs component in the Keep React provides a navigation aid that allows users to understand their current location within a website or application. With customizable options for type, icon, divider, line, and style, you can create breadcrumbs that align with your design and enhance the navigation experience.

## Default Breadcrumb

The default Breadcrumbs component provides a simple and intuitive way for users to understand their current location within a website or application. It offers a clean and unobtrusive design that enhances the overall navigation experience.

  <DefaultBreadcrumb />

## Breadcrumb With Border

The Breadcrumbs component with the `breadCrumbWithBorder` prop set to `true` adds a subtle border around each breadcrumb item, providing a clear visual separation between the items. This style enhancement helps improve the visibility of individual breadcrumbs and contributes to a more polished navigation experience.

## Breadcrumb With Page Icon

You can enhance the Breadcrumbs component by adding a page icon to each breadcrumb item. By utilizing the `icon` prop and providing an appropriate icon component, such as `<House size={24} color="#AFBACA" />`, you can visually represent each page or section within the breadcrumb navigation, making it easier for users to identify their current location within the website or application.

## Breadcrumb With Separator Icon

You can further customize the appearance of your breadcrumb navigation by adding a separator icon between items. This separator icon helps visually distinguish different sections of the navigation and enhances the overall user experience.
