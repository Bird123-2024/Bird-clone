## Vite React Application

After creating a React application with Vite, follow these steps to
install Tailwind CSS:

`Step 1:` Install Tailwind CSS

<CopyCode code={twNpmInstall} />

`Step 2:` Install Keep React:

<CopyCode code={keepNpmInstall} />

`Step 3:` Go to the `tailwind.config.js` file and paste the
following code:

<CopyCode code={twConfig} />

`Step 4:` Add Tailwind CSS to index.css File:

<CopyCode code={twCss} />

Congratulations! You have completed the installation. Now you can import any component from `keep-react` and start using it in your project.

<CopyCode code={CodeString} />

## Next JS Application

You can easily integrate `keep-react` into your Next.js application. Starting from Next.js version 13.4, the app router automatically installs Tailwind CSS, eliminating the need for a separate Tailwind CSS installation. If you have already installed Tailwind CSS as part of the Next.js application setup, you can proceed with Step 2. Otherwise, start with Step 1.

After creating a Next JS application, follow these steps to
install Tailwind CSS:

`Step 1:` Install Tailwind CSS

<CopyCode code={twNpmInstall} />

`Step 2:` Install Keep React

<CopyCode code={keepNpmInstall} />

`Step 3:` Go to the `tailwind.config.js` file and paste the
following code

<CopyCode code={twConfigForNextJs} />

`Step 4:` Add Tailwind CSS to globals.css File:

<CopyCode code={twCss} />

Now you can import any component from `keep-react` and start using it in your NextJS project.
