## Table of Contents

Use the accordion component and its options to expand and collapse the content inside each panel based on state reactivity from React and Tailwind CSS

## Default Accordion

Default Accordion Component allows you to create collapsible sections of content, commonly known as accordions.Users can toggle the visibility of the content by clicking on the disclosure button.

<CodePreview code={DefaultAccordionCode}>
  <DefaultAccordion />
</CodePreview>

## Accordion collapseAll

The `collapseAll` property of the Accordion allows you to control the default state of the accordion panels. When set to `true`, all panels are collapsed by default. Users can then expand individual panels by clicking on them.

<CodePreview code={AccordionCollapseAllCode}>
  <AccordionCollapseAll />
</CodePreview>

## Accordion With Left Side Icon

By using the `iconPosition="left"` property of the AccordionPanel component, you can shift the icon on the left side of the accordion panel header. This icon can be used to provide context or indicate the content within the panel.

<CodePreview code={AccordionWithLeftSideIconCode}>
  <AccordionWithLeftSideIcon />
</CodePreview>

## Accordion Always Open

By using the `alwaysOpen={true}` property of the Accordion component, you can configure all panels to remain open at all times. This means that users won't need to manually expand or collapse panels, as all content will be readily visible.

<CodePreview code={AccordionAlwaysOpenCode}>
  <AccordionAlwaysOpen />
</CodePreview>

## Disabled Accordion

By setting the `disabled={true}` property of specific AccordionPanel components, you can make those panels non-interactive. This ensures that users cannot expand or collapse these panels, allowing you to control the visibility of certain content.

<CodePreview code={DisabledAccordionCode}>
  <DisabledAccordion />
</CodePreview>
